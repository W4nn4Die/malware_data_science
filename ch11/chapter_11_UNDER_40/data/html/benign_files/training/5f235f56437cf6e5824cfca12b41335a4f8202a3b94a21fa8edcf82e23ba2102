                <p align="left">Atomic Caf&eacute; was a U.S. Government propaganda 
                  film indented to put American's at ease and &quot;not fear the 
                  atomic bomb.&quot; </p>
                <p align="left">Because no atomic weapons had (or have) been used 
                  against the U.S. at the time the film was made, U.S. government 
                  authorities &quot;had artistic license&quot; to feed the American 
                  public all sort of lies about what an atomic explosion would 
                  do to a city. <br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">And at the time the movie was made, a lot of the 
                  film and photos we see of the damage done to cities like Hiroshima 
                  and Nagasaki had not been released to the U.S. public yet. Atomic 
                  Caf&eacute; made the possibility of a nuclear attack by the 
                  Soviet Union no more dangerous than a winter blizzard. As the 
                  narrators in the movie quoted several times, if an attack occurred, 
                  all you had to do was &quot;duck and cover,&quot; as if a wooden 
                  desk wouldn't melt under the intense heat.<br>
                </p>
                <p align="left"><b>During the 1940's and 1950's A Fallout Bunker 
                  Was &quot;The Thing to Have&quot;</b><br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">Probably because of the memories of bomb shelters 
                  in Europe during World War II, combined with the reality that 
                  if a nuclear attack happened in the U.S., there wouldn't be 
                  enough time to evacuate to anywhere, a fallout bunker building 
                  boom started. <br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">Of course the U.S. government got involved and 
                  provided free building plans and blue prints for a variety of 
                  fallout bunkers that could be built in your own back yard. Looking 
                  back, it is ironic that this same government that taught Americans 
                  that &quot;the giant flash in the sky was nothing to worry about&quot; 
                  also wanted to give everyone free blueprints for fallout bunkers 
                  to hide in during a nuclear attack<br>
                  Most of the fallout bunkers built during this period were built 
                  out of sand bags or concrete blocks and mortar in a home basement, 
                  as this was the least expensive type of fallout bunker to build. 
                  The U.S. government's free plans and blueprints ensured that 
                  these bunkers offered substantial protection. </p>
                <p align="left">Looking back on it today, the amount of energy 
                  released by nuclear weapons being tested by both the U.S. and 
                  the Soviet Union during the 1950's would have vaporized those 
                  basement fallout bunkers in a close strike along with the people 
                  inside them.</p>
                <p align="left"><b>You Could Have a Fallout Bunker That Could 
                  Double As a Patio for Entertainment</b><br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">Some of the plans distributed by the U.S. Government 
                  were for underground fallout bunkers built apart from your home, 
                  usually built out of reinforced concrete walls or concrete blocks 
                  and mortar. The information provided assured that the thickness 
                  of the underground walls and the concrete roof (along with several 
                  feet of earth on top of that) would provide enough protection 
                  against even the highest levels of gamma rays from nuclear explosions. 
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">One marketing ploy was that the roofs of underground 
                  bunkers could double as back yard patios. One thing that was 
                  never mentioned in the government distributed material was how 
                  a family was supposed to survive outside the fallout bunkers 
                  when they ventured out two weeks after the blast to see if everything 
                  was alright. As we know now, there are Japanese citizens who 
                  are suffering from the effects of the bombs dropped on Japan 
                  and these victims weren't even alive yet in 1945.</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/family-fallout-bunker.jpg" width="670" height="490" border="1"><br>
                </p>
                <p align="left"><b>Just Two Weeks Was All You Needed</b><br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">U.S. government authorities recommended that people 
                  stay in their fallout bunkers for at least two weeks after a 
                  single nuclear blast. They never bothered to mention what the 
                  general public was supposed to do if there was hundreds of nuclear 
                  tipped warheads falling on the U.S. families with children were 
                  advised to keep recreational materials in their fallout bunkers 
                  to &quot;break the monotony.&quot; <br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">Board games such as Monopoly were often suggested 
                  as a good family game to keep everyone entertained in fallout 
                  bunkers. It was also suggested that playing card games and keeping 
                  a diary would pass the time. One can only wonder what it would 
                  be like to read a diary of someone hiding in a bunker and what 
                  kind of thoughts they would have had.<br>
                </p>
                <p align="left">In terms of cost, during the 1940's and 1950's 
                  fallout bunkers built in basements could cost as little as $200. 
                  Just how much protection those fallout bunkers provided was 
                  a question no one provided a clear answer to and it seems very 
                  few people ever asked. It's most likely no one wanted to know 
                  the real answer. Of course for nuclear strikes at a distance, 
                  the fallout bunkers did provide better protection than no protection.<br>
