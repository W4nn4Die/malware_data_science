                        <strong>The Steam Marketplace allows users of Steam to buy and sell digital goods tied to their Steam Accounts. With a bit of effort, you can turn your digital goods into some spare cash to help build up your Steam Wallet.</strong>

<p>A quick disclaimer before we begin. Unless you dedicate a ton of time and research into the workings and patterns of Steam's Marketplace, you aren't going to make a ton of money. Don't give up just yet! With the tips below you can end up adding some extra pocket money into your steam wallet, with pretty minimal effort.</p>

<h1>Collect them All!</h1>

<p>Steam Cards where introduced to Steam back in May 2013, and depending on how many compatible games you have, you can score a bit of extra cash by just playing the games you own. Steam cards come in two classifications, regular cards and rare foil cards. There are no differences between regular cards or foils, they both provide the same benefits, but the foil cards sell for a much higher price on the market due to their rarity.</p>

<p>The idea behind Steam cards is to collect a complete set of them for a specific game, and then use that set to craft a badge for that game. When you craft a badge, you will gain XP towards your Steam account, this XP is used to earn Steam levels. Most badges can be upgraded 5 times for additional XP, while event badges usually do not have a limit. The higher your Steam level the better chance you have at obtaining booster packs. Be sure to only craft badges during sale meta game events, as you will get a special card specifically for crafting a badge during the sale event.</p>   

<p>So how do you earn cards? Well, the first step to obtaining your cards is to figure out which of the games you own actually drop cards. To see for yourself, open your Steam client, go to the badge link under your user name on the navigation menu. Once on the badge page, you can scroll down the list of games you own and see which games have pending card drops. You earn the card drops by simply running the game via Steam. If you feel comfortable in doing so, you can use a 3rd party application like <a href="http://www.steamidlemaster.com" target="_blank">Idle Master</a> to do this automatically for you. Otherwise, if you have no interest in actually playing the game, you can just run it in the background while not using your PC. I've found that cards seem to drop for me about every 30 minutes or so.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt="" src="http://hashron.com/img/steammoney/getcards.jpg" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"></p>
 
<p>You will want to get all of the cards your eligible for ASAP, as you don't qualify for booster packs on games that still have remaining drops. Booster packs are a set of 3 cards from a specific game. You can open these for a chance at obtaining valuable foils, or for a chance to obtain cards you are missing to craft a badge. Booster packs can be sold on the marketplace as well. </p>

<p>Now how do you earn money from all of this madness? In regards to Steam Cards, I can think of three possible strategies with handling them. either an aggressive, balanced, or conservative approach.</p>


<h1>The Aggressive Strategy</h1>

<p>The aggressive strategy is to quite simply sell everything card related you obtain on your account. Earn a card, sell it, get a booster, sell it, earn a special event card, guess what, sell it! The upside of the aggressive strategy is that it requires the least amount of effort on your part. For any card or booster you gain, just sell it on the marketplace for the current going rate for a quick profit.</p>

<p>The downside of this strategy is that you will not gain any experience towards your steam level via cards. While Steam Levels are not a huge deal currently, if Valve continues to develop the Steam Level concept, you may miss out on potential future bonuses by having a low level. For example, with the current summer sale, you need to be at least Steam Level 5 to qualify for daily card drops from playing the special event game. Having a low Steam level will lower the chance of you obtaining booster packs, as shown on the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq/" target="_blank">Steam Trading Cards FAQ.</a></p>
	

<h1>The Balanced Strategy</h1>

<p>The balanced strategy's purpose is to slowly build up your Steam Level, while also making a bit of a profit on the side.</p>

<p>Here are the fundamentals of this strategy, for any cards you obtain, keep the ones you need to craft badges. You want to sell any boosters, or duplicate cards you obtain, and keep half of the profits you earn from selling them. Invest the other half into buying cards you need to build your badges. Alternatively, instead of selling boosters, you can open them for a chance at foils, but in my experience this chance is very low. Personally I've found that I've made more money by selling the booster packs then the luck I've had with getting foils out of them.</p>

<p>The advantages of this strategy is that you still get a steady cash flow, while slowly building up your Steam level. So if Valve decides to expand on the Steam level concept, you will be in a decent position. In addition, your chance of obtaining booster packs is higher then if you decide to sell everything. If you save crafting your badges until Steam sale events, you should score a bunch of extra special event cards. Make sure you craft your badges at the beginning of the sale, and to sell your special event cards quickly. As the sale goes on, the value of these special event cards will plummet, as after the sale is over, these cards disappear.</p>

<p>The downside of this strategy is the effort to manage your inventory is much higher then simply selling everything. You will be bouncing around menus, trying to find the going selling price for items, in order to maximize the profits from the items you are selling. You are hedging your position that building a steam level will be beneficial in the long run. If you where to sell everything, you may make more money in the long run if Valve does not add additional effects to the Steam level system.</p>


<h1>The Conservative Strategy</h1>

<p>The conservative strategy is the complete opposite of the aggressive strategy. If you follow this strategy you never sell any card items for profit, you trade, sell duplicates to fund the buying of cards you require to build your badges. The goal of this strategy is to build your Steam level as high as possible.</p>

<p>The advantages of this strategy are simple, if Valve ever expands on the Steam Level system, you will be in a prime position, as you should have a significant Steam Level by investing all your card resources into building it. Alternatively, during sale events, you should have a significant amount of badges ready to craft for the meta-games. Depending on the sale event, this could give you a wealth of resources to take advantage of these events to win rewards, or sell these resources for a high profit.</p>

<p>The downsides of this strategy are clear as well, if Valve doesn't expand on the steam level concept, basically you have dumped a lot of money into only having a nice big number beside your user name. This strategy also requires significant time for managing your steam inventory, and navigating the market to make the correct buy and sell request prices.</p>

<h1>Humble Bundles</h1>

<p>Humble Bundles are a great way to get a bunch of Steam games with cards for a cheap price. If the under the average games include Steam cards, the cards they drop usually sell for about 5-10 cents a pop. Humble Bundles are a nice way to donate to charity, get some cheap games, and some card profits!</p>

<h1>CS GO - Fragging and Getting Paid for It!</h1>

<p>If you enjoy CS GO, it's a great way to play games and earn some Steam money while you do it. The best way to earn some Steam cash via CSGO is by buying into CS GO operations early. If you can get into an operation during the first week, and have 5 to 10 hours to play during the first week of the operation, you are likely to obtain expensive crates that can be sold on the market for about five bucks a piece. You should make a profit or at least cover the expense of buying into the operation if you can get 2 of these crates during the first week. On-going, you will continue to obtain 1 or 2 operation crate drops per week from the operation. The price of these crates drop quick, so sell them as soon as you get them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt="" src="http://hashron.com/img/steammoney/csgo.jpg" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"></p>
   
<h1>Gambling</h1>
<p>Beyond playing the game to collect drops to sell, if you feel lucky, you can buy crates, and keys to open them, off of the steam marketplace. These crates can hold items that are worth hundreds of dollars, I don't do this myself, but its basically like playing a scratch and win for a chance to obtain High value items.</p>

<h1>Speculation</h1>
<p>A safer, more intelligent version of gambling on the Steam market, is speculating the possible trends of items on the market and buying and selling them accordingly. For example, if you look at a sack of gems on the market, with the current limited data for them, the sale price tends to go up as major sales occur, and drop quickly after. Therefore you could buy a significant amount of gems after a sale and sell them before a scheduled sale and make a nice profit for yourself. The market is unpredictable and Steam could add something to the mix which could greatly devalue gems, making your investment worthless, so invest carefully.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt="" src="http://hashron.com/img/steammoney/sackprice.jpg" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px;"></p>
		 
<h1>Luck</h1>

<p>Over the last year or so, there has been a couple of major glitches on the Steam market. The biggest glitch was when Valve introduced gems to the marketplace. When gems first showed up on Steam, there was a bug on the market which allowed gems to be duplicated. Because of this glitch, you could buy thousands of gems for pennies off of the market. You could then use these gems to craft booster packs, and then sell those cards for profit. Valve ended up rolling back the acquisition of gems, but the buying the selling of booster packs was not reversed. People who took advantage of this glitch earned a good amount of money. Alternatively, this flooded the market with cards and booster packs which ended up damaging the value of card market. Best way to be aware of these glitches is to monitor the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/steam" target="_blank">Steam subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>Be aware, if you abuse the system beyond regular usage of the Steam client, there is a risk of retribution from Valve. Gains earned via glitches can be rolled back if significant enough by Valve as well.</p>

<h1>Happy Hunting</h1>

<p>So I hope that helps you understand the Steam Market a bit more, and gives you some ideas on turning your inventory into a bit of extra cash. Good luck to you all out there!</p>                    <p class="rating">
