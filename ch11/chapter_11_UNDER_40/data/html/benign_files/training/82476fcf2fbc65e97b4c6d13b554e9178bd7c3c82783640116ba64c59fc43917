             as random forest, GBM, GLM (with elastic net regularization), and deep
             learning (feedforward multilayer networks), among others.

          The
<tt>stats::termplot()</tt>
          function package can be used to plot the
             terms in a model whose predict method supports
<tt>type=&quot;terms&quot;</tt>. 
             The
<a href="../packages/effects/index.html">effects</a>
          package provides graphical and tabular effect
             displays for models with a linear predictor (e.g., linear and generalized
             linear models).  Friedman’s partial dependence plots (PDPs), that are low
             dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function, are implemented
             in a few packages.
<a href="../packages/gbm/index.html">gbm</a>,
<a href="../packages/randomForest/index.html">randomForest</a>
          and
<a href="../packages/randomForestSRC/index.html">randomForestSRC</a>
          provide their own functions for displaying PDPs,
             but are limited to the models fit with those packages (the function
<tt>partialPlot</tt>
          from
<a href="../packages/randomForest/index.html">randomForest</a>
          is more limited since
             it only allows for one predictor at a time).  Packages
<a href="../packages/pdp/index.html">pdp</a>,
<a href="../packages/plotmo/index.html">plotmo</a>, and
<a href="../packages/ICEbox/index.html">ICEbox</a>
          are more general and allow for the
             creation of PDPs for a wide variety of machine learning models (e.g., random
             forests, support vector machines, etc.); both

             limited to two predictors while
<a href="../packages/pdp/index.html">pdp</a>
          uses trellis graphics to
             display PDPs involving three predictors).  By default,
<a href="../packages/plotmo/index.html">plotmo</a>
          fixes the background variables at their medians (or first level for factors)
             which is faster than constructing PDPs but incorporates less information.
<a href="../packages/ICEbox/index.html">ICEbox</a>
          focuses on constructing individual conditional expectation
             (ICE) curves, a refinement over Friedman's PDPs.  ICE curves, as well as
             centered ICE curves can also be constructed with the
<tt>partial()</tt>
          function from the

          package.
<a href="../packages/ggRandomForests/index.html">ggRandomForests</a>

  several feature selection methods. Similar, package

      interfaces
  several learning algorithms implemented in other packages and computes
  several performance measures.
