When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate.

<li><strong>Cookies and Clear gifs</strong><br />
To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that&#8217;s stored by your Web browser on your computer.

<li><strong>Analysis</strong><br />
We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of our Web sites, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets. These third parties may serve surveys to determine satisfaction with the Web site and then tie the responses to actual behavior on the Web site, which will allow us to improve our Web sites and Web capabilities. They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong><br />
We contract with third-party advertising companies which, in turn (1) place, use, and rely on cookies and web beacons when you interact with us through our Web sites and our email; (2) help us determine which of our products you may like, (3) use your basic personal information (such as name, address and email address) to help us associate your online purchases and interactions through and with us; and (4) deliver personalized online display and banner advertising to you on other Web sites, based on those purchases and interactions.

</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><a name="two"></a>How does this Web site interact with third-party Web sites and content?</p>
<p>We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We don&#8217;t endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don&#8217;t control and aren&#8217;t responsible for their Web practices. Whether the third-party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, those service provider&#8217;s terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there&#8217;s a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Cookies, Clear Gifs, and Online Network Advertising</strong><br />
You may always choose to block cookies or even clear cookies from your computer. Simply follow your browser&#8217;s instructions on how to block and clear cookies. Note that blocking cookies may not block the &#8220;first-party&#8221; cookies that are placed on your computer when you visit this site. By first-party cookies, we mean those cookies (whether placed by us or a contractor) that help us see how visitors use our site, and enable us to deliver our ads on our Web sites and other Web sites. Otherwise, clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Web sites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect. With respect to cookies used as part of a survey, if you do not want the use of cookies to associate survey responses with your behavior on the site, you can elect to not take the survey. If you want to opt out of the display of our online advertising, which appears on other Web sites, and which is based on the association of your online information with your offline information through interactions with us (purchase information, in particular), then please click the preference icon that may appear on such advertising. Additionally, if you want more information about online network advertising, in general, including access to some online network advertisers that allow you to designate your preferences, click here (you&#8217;ll then leave this site for a centrally managed online site where you may specify your preferences).</li>

</ol>
<p><a name="four"></a>How do we secure your information on our site?</p>
<p>This Web site has the following types of security measures: limited access data-centers, firewall technology, and secure-socket-layer (SSL) certificate authentication. SSL is encryption technology that provides security for information that&#8217;s transmitted over the Internet. This site accepts orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through SSL technology-for example, Internet Explorer (version 6.0 or higher), Firefox (version 3.0 or higher), Safari (version 4 or higher), Chrome (version 2 or higher), and AOL (version 9 or higher). While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.</p>
