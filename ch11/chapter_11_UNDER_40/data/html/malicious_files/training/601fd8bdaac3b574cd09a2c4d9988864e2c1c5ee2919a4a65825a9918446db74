<h3><strong>How to Become a Certified Medical Assistant</strong></h3>
<p>Job opportunities in the healthcare sector are growing rapidly, and enrolling for a medical assistant program can be a great way to get started on a career path that will guarantee you a fulfilling profession and job security. However, the best jobs are extremely competitive and only accessible to those with the highest level of professionalism in the discipline; hence, the need for medical assistant certification.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Is Medical Assistant Certification Necessary?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="Medical Assistant Certification in Glendale AZ" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ATMWebsitePics/medical-assistant-certification.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;float: right;width: 300px;height: 325px" />Having this certification serves as proof to your prospective employer that you have successfully met all the rigorous standards of the accrediting body: the Certifying Board of the American Association of Medical Assistant (AAMA). Certified medical assistants (CMAs) work in a clinic, a physician&rsquo;s office, or any other healthcare center that offers the necessary services to assist doctors and maintain the smooth operation of multiple functions at the facility. CMAs can take up specialized jobs in a healthcare center, though they are qualified to serve in a clinical, clerical and administrative capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While medical assistants can work without the certification, most employers prefer to hire CMAs since they can be certain that you are qualified and capable of providing proficient services in your capacity. Besides the higher access to a large number of job opportunities, certification also provides medical assistants with job security, greater expertise on the subject matter, and a better pay scale.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>So, How So You Become a Certified Medical Assistant?</strong></h3>
<p>The first step is to enroll in a medical assisting program that has been accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) or the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools (ABHES). Accredited courses are those that comply with the set of standards that is designed by the accrediting bodies to ensure that graduates are adequately prepared to work in the medical assisting profession. Upon the successful completion of the program, you will be eligible to sit for Certified Medical assistant exam.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What is a CMA examination?</strong></h3>
<p>This refers to the comprehensive test of knowledge that the AAMA deems as essential for today&rsquo;s medical office. The content is obtained from a thorough analysis of multiple administrative, clinical and general tasks performed by medical assistants on a daily basis. The CMA exam tests the student&rsquo;s knowledge in three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative knowledge including the collection and management of medical records and insurance processing&nbsp;</li>
<li>General medical knowledge including relevant terminology, medical law and ethics, behavioral science, anatomy and physiology, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clinical knowledge including the preparation and administration of medication, examination room techniques, and laboratory and pharmacology procedures.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The examination is administered every January and June at more than 200 test sites in the US. Students must apply through the AAMA in order to take the certification exam. Once it approves your application, you are required to schedule an exam time. However, students who graduate from unaccredited programs are not allowed to take certification exams. As such, you must always check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accrediting_Bureau_of_Health_Education_Schools">ABHES</a> and CAAHEP websites to ensure that your school is accredited, before enrolling in the medical assistant program.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aama-ntl.org/">AAMA</a>, American Association of Medical Assistants&nbsp;assists applicants to prepare for the exam by offering them a Candidate&rsquo;s Guide to the CMA certification examination. Students who pass the examination are awarded an official certificate that permits them to seek employment using the title Certified Medical Assistant.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Are Certified Medical Assistants Required to Recertify?</strong></h3>
<p>Medical assistant certifications are valid for only 5 years, which means that CMAs must recertify before this period is over to keep their credential current. Whether employed or seeking employment, medical assistants are only allowed to use the CMA credential with regard to their occupation as long as it is current. A medical assistant&rsquo;s certification status can be easily checked by calling the AAMA, since the records are open to the public. CMAs have two ways to recertify: either pass the CMA recertification exam provided by AAMA, or earn 60 recertification points via continuing education. For recertification using the latter option, CMAs are allowed to choose from a plethora of CEU courses that are sponsored by national, state and local AAMA groups. Alternatively, CMAs can take up self-study courses provided via the Continuing Education Department of the AAMA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obtaining the medical assistant certification serves as an indicator that you have the necessary technical and analytical skills to perform well in your job. However, to enjoy a successful and rewarding career in this field, you must possess the ideal traits of a CMA, which include courtesy, integrity, attentiveness, excellent communication skills, and a true desire to assist and educate others.</p>
<p>With the above information, you shouldn&#039;t have a problem making an informed decision about <strong>how to become a Certified Medical Assistant</strong>.&nbsp;Take the first step towards a bright future by requesting information from some of the schools listed above for Medical Assistant Certification in your area.</p>
