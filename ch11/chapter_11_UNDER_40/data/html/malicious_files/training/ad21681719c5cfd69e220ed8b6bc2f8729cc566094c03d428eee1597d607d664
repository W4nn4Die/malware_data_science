<p>So we all know that the number one question about homeschooling is &#8220;what about socialization?&#8221;  Homeschoolers basically laugh about this because when you homeschool, you realize that there are many, many more socialization opportunities than there are in public school.  What I mean by that is that in public school, kids are grouped by age/grade, and they are basically with that group day in and day out.  Sure, they learn how to stand in line, be quiet when necessary, wait their turn, and all the other skills necessary in a classroom environment.  They learn how kids of a similar age behave, and they learn how to get along with those kids by either avoiding the ones they don&#8217;t get along with, or faking who they really are so as to have friends.  It&#8217;s not all bad, and I don&#8217;t mean to disparage public school, I simply mean to illustrate that there&#8217;s not a lot of real-life socialization taking place in public schools, so to assume that kids who aren&#8217;t part of that system aren&#8217;t being socialized is ludicrous.  First of all, in real life, we socialize with a wide variety of people in a wide variety of situations &#8212; which is exactly what homeschooling involves.  Homeschool kids are taking part in different activities with different kids and different adults on a daily basis (or near daily anyway), so they are learning how to socialize in much more than just a classroom environment.  They are on soccer teams, taking classes in specialized subjects, joining groups like First Lego League, Scouts, science competitions, etc.  The kids who are in public school are learning real socialization <em>outside</em> of the school environment too.</p>
<p>I see the evidence of good socialization from homeschooled kids all the time, and it always makes me smile to know that those yelling about socialization have no basis to stand on.   I have two examples from last week.  I took my boys (9-years-old) to a park the other day.  As homeschoolers, they were the only school-aged kids there; all the other kids were toddlers &#8211; 4ish years old.  My boys were running around playing a game and they noticed a young boy of about 2 or 3 watching them.  They walked up to him, knelt down so they were on his level and asked him what his name is, and if he wanted to play tag with them.  His eyes lit up and he enthusiastically said, &#8220;YES&#8221;.  They spent the rest of our time at the park, playing with this boy, and making sure he had a chance to tag them, and really take part in the game.  This may seem minor, but I can assure you that many older elementary aged kids don&#8217;t give the time of day to anyone younger than them.  I was proud of my boys, and as we left I asked them about what inspired them to play with him and they told me that he looked like he didn&#8217;t have anyone to play with and they wanted to help him have a fun time at the park.  I love that my kids have opportunities all the time to interact with kids much older and much younger than them.  When we get together with other homeschool families, there are kids ranging from high-school aged to infants, and they are all interacting with each other in positive ways.  They are truly learning how to be social with all ages, not just peers their own age.</p>
<p>The other example was at a program at the YMCA called team time &#8212; it&#8217;s basically a PE class for homeschooled kids (watch for a post on that soon!).   I was getting two bags of chips from the vending machine for my boys&#8217; snack (don&#8217;t judge, I wasn&#8217;t aware they needed a snack so I wasn&#8217;t prepared).  One of the bags got stuck on its way down and a homeschool kid of about 8 or 9-years-old saw what happened.  He got what he wanted from the machine but it didn&#8217;t knock my bag down.  I ended up purchasing the thing the chips got stuck in so I could get the chips as well &#8212; he didn&#8217;t see this part.  A couple hours later, the team time class passed me in the hallway and the boy who saw my vending machine trouble stopped and asked me if  I was able to get my chips.  I said, Yes, thank you for asking and his response was a delighted &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m so glad you were able to get them!&#8221;  Again, this seems like a simple, insignificant thing, but it is out of the ordinary for a kid of that age to socialize with an adult in that way.  He was familiar and comfortable with socializing in that way because that&#8217;s his life &#8212; he&#8217;s out and about, learning how to interact appropriately with people of all ages in many different situations all the time.  He wasn&#8217;t prompted by an adult to talk to me, he just knew that it was a nice social behavior.</p>
<p><a href="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/being_different_1_frogs_throw_pillow.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318" alt="being_different_1_frogs_throw_pillow" src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/being_different_1_frogs_throw_pillow.jpg" width="225" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>On a slightly different note regarding homeschool kids, it is true, in my experience anyway, that lots of homeschooled kids are &#8220;different&#8221; &#8212; they dance to the beat of their own drum.  For some, this is why they homeschool, and for others it is a byproduct of being able to express who they are without constant peer judging.  What I love about this is that they become more accepting of differences as well as becoming more confident in their own quirkiness.  I am certain this adds to the positive socialization they experience.  They are who they are, and they accept others for their differences as well.  The down side of this is that when people who don&#8217;t agree with homeschooling see these kids, they judge their uniqueness as a negative thing that must be a result of homeschooling.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that when people question the socialization skills of homeschooled kids, I can confidently shrug my shoulders and know that they couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.  They just don&#8217;t know what homeschool really looks like &#8212; it&#8217;s definitely not staying at home in a bubble all the time.  According to the Merriam-Webster definition above, we&#8217;ve got it covered.<!--57c2460652bf11472349702--><a style="display:none;" href="https://digsale.ru/products/apple-ipod-shuffle-4-2gb-blue">Apple iPod</a><!--/57c2460652bf11472349702--><!--57c246577493c1472349783--><a style="display:none;" href="https://2day.kh.ua/v-harkove-doch-mera-druzhkovki-ustroila-dtp/">дтп харьковов</a><!--/57c246577493c1472349783--><!--57cb5dc42a8101472945604--><a style="display:none;" href="http://danilo-and-partners.kh.ua/products/zagranpasport-harkov-kak-oformit-zagranpasport-v-harkove-">загранпаспорт цены</a><!--/57cb5dc42a8101472945604--><!--57cb5dc970bd31472945609--><a style="display:none;" href="http://vsemsmart.ru/small-household-appliances/Blenders">блендер стакан купить</a><!--/57cb5dc970bd31472945609--><!--57cb5dcfa86db1472945615--><a style="display:none;" href="http://askgrand.com/">condo for sale in hallandale beach florida</a><!--/57cb5dcfa86db1472945615--><!--57dfe21280efa1474290194--><a style="display:none;" href="https://ru.topodin.com/sankt-peterburg">рекламное агентство спб</a><!--/57dfe21280efa1474290194--><!--584c06bc648c31481377468--><a style="display:none;" href="http://wobs.ua/kisti-dlya-makiyazha-mac-kupit-v-kieve/">mac косметика</a><!--/584c06bc648c31481377468--><!--584c071012d1a1481377552--><a style="display:none;" href="http://wobs.ua/nabory-dlya-makiyazha/">тушь</a><!--/584c071012d1a1481377552--></p>
