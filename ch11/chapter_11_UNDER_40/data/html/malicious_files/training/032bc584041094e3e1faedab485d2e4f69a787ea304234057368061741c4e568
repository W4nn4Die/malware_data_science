I'm afraid however, after reading a few profiles on here, that it will turn into one huge bitchfest. This site should not be about Bush bashing or bashing anyone for that matter , it shouldn't be about if you are for or against the war. We should all support our toops no matter what we think of Bush or if we approve or disapprove of the war.The issue here should be about getting back to the basics.God, family, morals. How do we do that in a society that I see as spinning out of control? We have kids killing kids in school, teenage pregnancy is rampant, children have no morals, no fear of consequences to thier actons. Mother and father are both working and the children are being raised by day care workers. <br /><br />Parental Alienation and the antiquated laws of the family court system that allow good men to be alienated from thier children because of vindictive women .The family court and judges just don't care! No matter how much time and money are spent and evidence presented the woman still wins primary placement and continues to alienate the father. The children are the one's who suffer the most.Every child should be allowed to love both mother and father without interference from the alienating parent. Please don't get me wrong, women are also alienated from their kids , it's just that in the majority of cases it is the woman that is doing the alienating. <br /></td></tr>
