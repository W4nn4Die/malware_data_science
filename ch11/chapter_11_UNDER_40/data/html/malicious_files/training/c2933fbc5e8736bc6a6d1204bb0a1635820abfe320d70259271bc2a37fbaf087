<p>Well, I obviously took the Summer off to relax and have some fun with Andrew &amp; Brian, as evidenced by my complete lack of posting.  Though we all love our traditional Summers of not officially doing school, it goes without saying that there is learning happening everyday.  We read (always a daily activity), attend an occasional science summer camp, and take random trips to museums; but overall we enjoy many days of lounging by the pool, hanging out with friends, playing games, and just being.  But alas, Fall is approaching quickly and school planning must commence.  We have our curriculum all set and mostly ready to go (a few more items to purchase) and I am very excited to see how it goes this year &#8212; the boys are, as expected, groaning about the prospect of not eternally lounging, but such is life <img src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we have in the plans this year:</p>
<p><a href="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/images.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380" alt="images" src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/images.jpeg" width="280" height="180" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Math:</strong></span>  <a href="http://www.teachingtextbooks.com/">Teaching Textbooks 6 </a>&#8212; this is a curriculum the boys will be doing on the computer.  They watch the lessons, then do the practice problems and quizzes on the computer.  If they get answers wrong, there is a review and additional problems until they master the topic.  The idea here is that they will be more independent when it comes to math.  They are both pretty strong in this subject, and I will be here to help, but overall they will be completing it on their own, at their own pace.  My plan is to have them do 1 hour of math as opposed to one lesson each day &#8212; this way they can more easily progress at their own pace.  As with all subjects, there will be portions/lessons that are easier than others and the time goal as opposed to the lesson goal will allow them to breeze through the easier lessons and take their time with the more difficult.  Although the curriculum is level 6, it is 5th grade math they&#8217;ll be doing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>English/Language Arts:</strong></span>  This basically encompasses reading and writing.  For reading we will be participating in a book club with another homeschool family, which we are all very excited about.  The first book on our list is The Hobbit (no surprise that the boys are really pleased with this selection!).  We plan to meet each week and discuss the chapters we read/characters/writing style/etc., and we&#8217;ll throw in some fun activities along the way that relate to the reading.  In addition to the book club, I have some other books that the boys will read and they&#8217;ll follow up with some writing activities related to the books.  For writing, we&#8217;ll be using the <a href="http://www.evan-moor.com/p/2021/daily-6-trait-writing-grade-5">Daily 6-trait writing</a> workbook for grade 5, as well as some bigger writing projects throughout the year.  For the bigger writing projects, we will be using some simple how to books from  <a href="https://cherrylakepublishing.com/shop/show/10879">Cherry Lake Publishing</a>.  I have a few of them picked out and we&#8217;ll add as needed.  The boys are also toying with the idea of starting a blog, which will be a good addition to our writing curriculum for this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_386" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-386" alt="photo" src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo1-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anywhere is a good reading spot!</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Science:</strong></span>  Last year I didn&#8217;t use a complete curriculum for Science and the boys needed/wanted more than I was offering.  We did 4th grade chemistry, but we didn&#8217;t do enough experiments and hands-on learning for their taste, so this year we&#8217;re changing it up a bit.  We&#8217;ll be using <a href="http://www.pandiapress.com/?page_id=50">REAL Science Odyssey, Biology 2</a>.  This is a pretty involved science curriculum and the boys are really excited to immerse themselves in science this year.  The REAL stands for Read, Explore, Absorb, Learn.  I&#8217;m excited because we purchased a lab kit that offers everything we&#8217;ll need to do all the experiments, which will make doing them much easier for all of us &#8212; if there&#8217;s one thing I hate, it&#8217;s trying frantically to gather all the materials needed for a science lab and coming up one or two items short.  Our lab kit ensures that we won&#8217;t have that issue this year.  The curriculum involves reading the text, answering some questions, doing a lab, and writing up the experiment (scientific method).  There is also a section with each chapter that explores a famous scientist relating to the material.</p>
<div id="attachment_385" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-385" alt="photo" src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our Science Lab Kit from hometrainingtools.com</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>History:</strong></span>  We&#8217;ll be continuing our study of world history by reading Story of the World, part 2.  They loved Story of the World 1 last year so it was a given that we&#8217;d continue with that text.  Last year we also started with American History so we&#8217;ll continue with that this year as well.  They&#8217;ll be starting the year attending a class on the Civil War.  When that class is over we&#8217;ll continue our study of American History with a series of books titled <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/history-of-us-joy-hakim/1102472950?cm_mmc=googlepla-_-book_45up-_-q000000633-_-9780195327267&amp;ean=9780195327267&amp;isbn=9780195327267&amp;r=1">A History of US</a>.  We also plan on taking some trips up the coast to visit some historical sites.  We love to make History real around here, and being on the East coast makes it easy to do with an abundance of quick road trips to historical sites!</p>
<div id="attachment_384" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-384" alt="photo (1)" src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo-1-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Living History Lessons are the best!</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Art:</strong></span>  We&#8217;ll be using a curriculum called <a href="http://meetthemasters.com/">Meet The Masters</a> this year and I can&#8217;t wait to get started with it!  For each artist studied, the boys will start by learning about his/her  life and famous works, then they complete a technique packet where they will learn about the technique used by the artist, reinforce what they learned about the artist, and get prepared for the final step.  The final step is to complete an art project using the artist&#8217;s technique.  We&#8217;ll be covering 15 artists this year!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Music:</strong></span>  Andrew &amp; Brian will continue with their weekly Trumpet (Brian) and French Horn (Andrew) lessons.  We also have tickets to all the children&#8217;s concerts for the NC symphony, and prior to each concert, we&#8217;ll be learning about the music and composers we&#8217;ll be hearing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PE:</strong></span>  I have plenty of yard work projects to keep the boys physically fit 😉  Actually, we&#8217;ll be signing them up for Team Time at the YMCA which is a PE program for homeschooled kids &#8212; they play different organized sports/games each week and they come home red in the face and sweaty from all the exertion.  We also meet our homeschool friends at a park weekly and after playing on the park structures, there is often a pick-up game of soccer that starts &#8212; which also ends up with them sweaty and red <img src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Extra Curricular:</strong></span>  We can&#8217;t forget First Lego League!  We have a fantastic team again this year and it&#8217;s one of the best cross-curricular activities we&#8217;ve come across.  The boys learn so much about teamwork, about engineering, about programming, about research, about presentations, and more.  There are many homeschool teams, but if you have a child in public or private school, there are many teams there too so check with your child&#8217;s principal or teacher and if they don&#8217;t have an existing FLL program, ask them to start one up!  You can also start one up outside of a school setting, so it&#8217;s quite flexible &#8212; all you need is a few willing kids and a coach!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other:</strong> </span> We have some field trips in the works for this year &#8212; the Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant, the Great Harvest Bread Company, the 3-story robot in the NC State library, the Jordan Lake Dam, and more.  We&#8217;ll also be continuing with our Walking Classroom, which is always a fun diversion, and as always with homeschooling:  we&#8217;ll go with the flow and take advantage of opportunities that pop up along the way <img src="http://kirkschoolhouse.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
